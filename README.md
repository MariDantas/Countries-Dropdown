# Countries Dropdown

## Description
This project was created in collaboration with the Learn JavaScript website. It provides a function named ```getDropdown()``` that takes an array of country names as input and generates an HTML string representing a dropdown menu with these countries as options. This dropdown string is returned to the **index.js** file, where it can be displayed in a web page.

## Executing the Project
As this project doesn't use the HTTP protocol and requires running on a local server due to the presence of modules, follow these steps for execution:
1. **Download and install Visual Studio Code:** If you don't have it already, download and install Visual Studio Code, a lightweight and powerful code editor available for multiple platforms.
2. **Install the "Live Server" extension:** In Visual Studio Code, click the gear icon and select "Extensions" from the dropdown menu. In the search box, type "Live Server" and select it from the search results to install the extension. This extension will be used to serve the project locally.
3. **Open the project folder:** After installing the "Live Server" extension, open Visual Studio Code and click the "Open Folder" button in the "Explorer" tab. Select the folder containing the "Countries Dropdown" project files.
4. **Start the local server:** In the bottom right corner of the Visual Studio Code window, locate the "Go Live" text and click it. This will start the local server and automatically open the project in your default web browser.
5. **Test and execute:** Your default web browser will display the project with the dropdown menu generated based on the provided country names. You can now interact with the dropdown and test its functionality.
6. **Stop the server:** To stop the local server, simply click the same corner where the port number is now displayed. The server will terminate, and the project will no longer be accessible through the browser.
